# Portfolio of work by Jessica Krook

# Instructions for the repository 

Each project is divided into different Names. Here each Name is explained, and I have given a brief overview of the project. 

## 2MARKET 

The files labelled 2MARKET are related to a project where exploratory data analysis is done on a supermarket’s customer purchase behaviour.  

2MARKET_Report is the final report including an appendix where you can find SQL code and Excel Analysis.

*NOTE: this is basic SQL and I am able to create complex queries*

2MARKET_Tableau_Dashboard contains a link to a Public Dashboard I created using the supermarket's data.

## BOOKING_PLATFORM_BUSINESS_CASE

This file is the presentation for a project I did looking at a booking platforms potential for new markets in Asia. 

All analysis was done using PowerBI.

## CALIFORNIA_HOUSING

The files labelled CALIFORNIA_HOUSING is a data science project where I took a dataset of California houses and created a model using machine learning to predict house prices based on different variables using R.

CALIFORNIA_HOUSING_Supervised_Machine_Learning _Regression is the R code used to create the model.

CALIFORNIA_HOUSING_Supervised_Machine_Learning _Regression_Report is the final report including the visualisations made in R that are not visible in the R file.

## ERD_ANALYSIS 

The file labelled ERD_ANALYSIS are related to a project where I analysed a basic ERD relational database.  

ERD_ANALYSIS is the final report including MY SQL code and my reasoning for the way I constructed the queries.

## GAMING_LOYALTY_ANALYSIS

The files labelled GAMING_LOYALTY_ANALYSIS is a project analysing customer trends of a gaming company.

GAMING_LOYALTY_ANALYSIS.R uses R to perform exploratory data analysis and evaluate the normality of the data.

GAMING_LOYALTY_ANALYSIS.ipynb uses Python to perform linear regression, k-means clustering and NLP on the data to make predictions of customer behaviour and loyalty.

GAMING_LOYALTY_ANALYSIS_Report is the final report, including visualizations from both the R and Python files to communicate insights and recommendations from the analysis performed.

## HOUSING_DETAILS

This is an exploratory data analysis project that looks at what influences the value of houses.

HOUSING_DETAILS.R is the code for the data analysis.

HOUSING_DETAILS_Report is the final report with insights from the analysis.

## NHS_DATA_ANALYSIS.ipynb

This is a Python file where I analysed the staffing requirements of the NHS. It includes, EDA, creating visualizations to find trends, and using text to gain insights and give recommendations.

## PREDICTING_HOUSING_PRICES_WITH_ML.ipynb

This is a project where I use advanced machine learning techniques in Python on a housing dataset to predict the price and evaluate which machine learning model is the most accurate.

## TRANSPORTATION_COMPANY_BUSINESS_CASE

This file is the presentation for a project I did where ì evaluate the most profitable entities and routes of a transportation company.

All analysis was done using PowerBI.
